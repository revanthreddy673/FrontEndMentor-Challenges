## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- I designed for desktop first and then gone for mobile version

### What I learned

One main thing I learnt from this challenge is,"Never use fixed heights and Widths". Infact try to avoid giving heights to elements, let the content decide the height . Use padding if you want some space around the content which will eventually increase the height of the element.

### Continued development

Margin and padding are the things that I would like to imporove in the future challenges.
