## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- I designed for desktop first, then moved to mobile

### What I learned

	Using flex direction:column to align things perfectly is the biggest learning.
	use width:100% on flex-items to make each flex-item occupy the same space as the other.

### Continued development

	I would always like to improve my code with each and every project.
